# Casemath Roadmap
In this repository, you can find Casemath's public roadmap. Here you can see what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we aim to have them ready! You can also report any bugs and request new features. 

# How to use

To see what we're working on currently, click on Projects along the toolbar at the top (just below Casemath/roadmap, about halfway along).

To report a bug or request new features, click on Issues along the toolbar at the top (on the left, directly below Casemath/roadmap). Then click on "New issue" on the right and choose the template for the issue you wish to submit. Fill out the details and post it! We'll get back to you as soon as possible.
